# Authenticated AJAX POST to AWS S3 example ðŸ™Œ

Is there a faster or more pleasant way to upload from a generic Web browser?

# FAQ

Q: Does it support **multiple** [file uploads](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#file-upload-state-(type=file))?

A: No, because AWS POST API does not support multiple file uploads

# Setup

Create `.creds.ini` with

	awsid = 'awsid'
	secret = 'awssecret'
	bucket = 'yourbucket'
	region = 'ap-southeast-1'

Don't forget to hide `.creds.ini` from being served ! Sample [Caddyfile configuration](https://caddyserver.com/):

	up.example.com {
		tls webmaster@example.com
		root /srv/up.webmaster.com/
		fastcgi / 127.0.0.1:9000 php
		basicauth / hendry letmein
		log up.access.log
		errors up.error.log
		rewrite {
			r   /\.(.*)
			status 404
		}
	}
